## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.
## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
# Get and print the installation path
tinytex_path <- tinytex::tinytex_root()
cat("TinyTeX Installation Path:", tinytex_path, "\n")
```
